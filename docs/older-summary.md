## Next Steps for These Projects

### Immediate Actions (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] Review security advisories for all projects
- [ ] Update dependencies for Rust projects
- [ ] Document architectural decisions for catalog ecosystem
- [ ] Create .ai/context.md files for top 5 projects

### Short-term Actions (1 month)
- [ ] Evaluate which projects should move to Tier 1 (active development)
- [ ] Identify projects for archival/consolidation
- [ ] Update READMEs with current status
- [ ] Run security audits on all projects

### Long-term Strategy (3-6 months)
- [ ] Consider consolidating catalog ecosystem projects
- [ ] Evaluate Python project maintenance strategy
- [ ] Update forked projects or document divergence
- [ ] Create integration documentation between related projects

## Risk Assessment

### Maintenance Burden
- **High:** Catalog ecosystem (3 interconnected projects)
- **Medium:** AI tooling (4 independent projects)
- **Low:** Games and utilities (well-scoped)

### Technology Risk
- **Experimental:** WASM + Emacs integration
- **Stable:** Rust CLI tools
- **Dependency:** Forked research projects (upstream changes)

### Strategic Value
- **High:** AI tooling infrastructure (proact, emacs-ai-api)
- **High:** Catalog ecosystem (if unified strategy exists)
- **Medium:** Research projects (knowledge value)
